    <h1>The History</h1>
      <p>Race Pace was built as a personal project by Michael McCarry. A Computer Engineer by trade and triathlete by heart, Michael put together his two skills to provide a tool for analizing training data to a higher degree. Race Pace was a solution for figuring out how to tell his loved ones just how long the bike leg of the race should take him. </p>
